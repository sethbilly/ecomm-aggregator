# Ectools Aggregator
Microservice to handle incoming product messages sent by Ectools Importer to
create a new product if it doesnâ€™t exist in its database, and update it if it was already
there.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development, testing and even to production.

### Prerequisites
You need to install the following and add to system paths.
```
docker
```
If you prefer not to run in a docker container install the following
```
java
maven
```

### Running
Clone or download repository and run maven in the root of the directory. A step by step
series of actions that tell you how to get project running. 
The application also contains a dockerfile. The application will run in a docker container.
#### Running application with docker container
```
project_root_directory > mvn clean package
```
Build the docker image 
```
project_root_directory> docker build -t ectools-aggregator .
```
Once the docker image has been built, you can run it using the command
```
project_root_directory> docker run -p 8085:8085 ectools-aggregator
```
```$xslt
project_root_directory> docker-compose up 
```
This will spin up containers for mongo and activemq.
#### Running the microservice with maven
```
project_root_directory > mvn clean  package
```
Compiles and builds classes and resources into jar file. A target folder 
is generated containing the build.
##### windows platform
```
project_root_directory > java -jar \target\ectools-aggregator-1.0.jar
```
##### unix platform
```
project_root_directory > java -jar /target/ectools-aggregator-1.0.jar
```
This will spin an embedded tomcat server and the application
can be accessed on localhost and port set in the application.properties
file in the source directory of the project
```
http://localhost:8085
```
